# Testing
This app has limited testing currently, and should be improved upon.
Jest or React Testing Library is a useful tool to test individual components, and should be used in combinatin with mocking or stubbing to test only the relevant criteria per test.

Cypress is another tool useful for further integration or E2E testing, which should be used to test the app in more depth between multiple components and pages.

For all testing, all outcomes possible should be tested, including errors and edge cases to ensure the application gracefully handles them and provides a robust and clean user experience.
